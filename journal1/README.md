# Satisfaction with Strong
by Joseph Macam, 3/7/2021

Strong is a fitness mobile app that is used to maintain workout routines and track your fitness progress. 
My goals when using this app are typically to be able to start a workout and to be able to go through my 
workout routine smoothly while also giving me some slight motivation during my progress. 

##### A screenshot of the app when first opening it:

The Usability/UX goals I want to highlight with this app are the **satisfaction** and the **efficency**. Working out, although 
beneficial to one's health, is a stressful activity. With the sweat, soreness, and being consistenly running out 
of breathe, working out is taxing. However, using Strong, when one finishes a set of an exercise, 2
things happen:
1. The set for that exercise highlights with a green color
2. An auditory light hearted "ding" plays

These 2 things in combination have a motivating and sort of serotonin inducing effect on me while I am
working out. Green is a color commonly associated with completion and correctness, so seeing the set
I just finished highlight green gives me a sense of finality and accomplishment in finishing an exercise.
Secondly, the pleasant sounding "ding" that plays when a set is complete acts as a sort of reward for
completing the set. It gives the same sense of accomplishment the green highliting gives, but is instead
satisfying for our hearing sense than our visual sense. This color change also contributes to the **efficiency**
of the app, as I can clearly see my progress in the workout by seeing how much of my sets are completed in 
green. The app also tracks the previous workout session's weight and rep volume, so I am able to easily
make adjustments based on my previous progress.
