# Satisfaction with Strong
by Joseph Macam, 3/7/2021

Strong is a fitness mobile app that is used to maintain workout routines and track your fitness progress. My goals when using this app is typically to be able to start a workout and be able to go through my 
workout routine smoothly while also giving me some slight motivation during my progress.
