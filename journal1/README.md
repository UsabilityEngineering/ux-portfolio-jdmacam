# Satisfaction with Strong
by Joseph Macam, 3/7/2021

Strong is a fitness mobile app that is used to maintain workout routines and track your fitness progress. 
My goals when using this app is typically to be able to start a workout and be able to go through my 
workout routine smoothly while also giving me some slight motivation during my progress. 

##### A screenshot of the app when first opening it:

The Usability/UX goal I want to highlight with this app is the **satisfaction** aspect. Working out, although 
beneficial to one's health, is a stressful activity. With the sweat, soreness, and consistenly running out 
of breathe, working out is taxing. However, using Strong, when one finishes a set of an exercise, 2
things happen:
1. The set for that exercise highlights with a green color
2. An auditory light hearted "ding" plays

These 2 things in combination have a motivating and sort of serotonin inducing effect on me while I am
working out. Green is a color commonly associated with completion and correctness, so seeing the set
I just finished highlight green gives me a sense of finality and accomplishment in finishing an exercise.
Secondly, the pleasanyt sounding "ding" that plays when a set is complete acts as a sort of reward for
completing the set. It gives the same sense of accomplishment the green highliting gives, but is instead
satisfying for our hearing sense than our visual sense.
