# Lifesum UI/UX
by Joseph Macam, 5/2/2021

Lifesum is a food tracking mobile used to keep track of what foods you eat and your daily caloric intake. 
My goals when using this app are typically to be able to find the foods I wish to add to my food log quick
and efficiently and to be able to make changes to my log in case of entry mistakes. 

The Usability/UX goals I want to highlight with this app are the **efficiency** and **error tolernace** aspects. 
Using a food intake tracking app, the steps to adding an item should be quick and simple, and one shouldn't have to struggle
with the menus to add a single food item. Thanfully, Lifesum does a pretty good job at making food entries simple and efficient.
The main landing page shows 4 meal sections for that current day. To make a food entry, you first choose the desired meal
you want to add an entry to and tap the "+" icon. This will then take you to a food search page.

From the food search page, you simply enter the food you'd like to enter. You can also add the brand name for a more refined search. Once
you have found the food you wish to add, you once again tap the "+" icon next to that food, which will then take you to that food's page.

Here you are given options about how much of the food you would like to add based on different measurements. They can be the labeled 
"serving size" that appears on the nutrition label, or you can choose a more specific measurement such as grams or cups. You can
also tap the grayed out heart icon next to the food name to add it to your favoites for quicker searches. With your measurements selected,
you simply tap the "Track" button on the bottom and the food will be added to the meal you had chosen prior.

These 2 things in combination have a motivating and sort of serotonin inducing effect on me while I am
working out. Green is a color commonly associated with completion and correctness, so seeing the set
I just finished highlight green gives me a sense of finality and accomplishment in finishing an exercise.
Secondly, the pleasanyt sounding "ding" that plays when a set is complete acts as a sort of reward for
completing the set. It gives the same sense of accomplishment the green highliting gives, but is instead
satisfying for our hearing sense than our visual sense.
