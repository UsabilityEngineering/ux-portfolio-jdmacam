# Lifesum UI/UX
by Joseph Macam, 5/2/2021

Lifesum is a food tracking mobile used to keep track of what foods you eat and your daily caloric intake. 
My goals when using this app are typically to be able to find the foods I wish to add to my food log quick
and efficiently and to be able to make changes to my log in case of entry mistakes.

The Usability/UX goal I want to highlight with this app is the **satisfaction** aspect. Working out, although 
beneficial to one's health, is a stressful activity. With the sweat, soreness, and consistenly running out 
of breathe, working out is taxing. However, using Strong, when one finishes a set of an exercise, 2
things happen:
1. The set for that exercise highlights with a green color
2. An auditory light hearted "ding" plays

These 2 things in combination have a motivating and sort of serotonin inducing effect on me while I am
working out. Green is a color commonly associated with completion and correctness, so seeing the set
I just finished highlight green gives me a sense of finality and accomplishment in finishing an exercise.
Secondly, the pleasanyt sounding "ding" that plays when a set is complete acts as a sort of reward for
completing the set. It gives the same sense of accomplishment the green highliting gives, but is instead
satisfying for our hearing sense than our visual sense.
